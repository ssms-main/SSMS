## Download SSMS
#### [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 20.2](https://kpwik.com/qn/)
SSMS 20.2 is the newest stable release (GA). If you currently have a preview version of SSMS 20 installed, you should uninstall it before proceeding with the installation of SSMS 20.2. Please note that installing SSMS 20.2 will not upgrade or replace SSMS 19.x or any earlier versions.

By using SQL Server Management Studio, you acknowledge and accept its [license terms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms/) and [privacy policy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement). If you have feedback, suggestions, or wish to report issues, the most effective way to reach the SSMS team is via the SSMS Developer Community site.

The SSMS 20.x installation does not upgrade or replace SSMS 19.x or any previous versions. SSMS 20.x will be installed alongside earlier versions, so you will have both available. However, if a previous preview version of SSMS 20 is installed, you need to uninstall it before installing the latest stable version of SSMS 20. To check if you have a preview version, go to the **Help** > **About** window.
